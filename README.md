# Covid_tweets_Flesch
This was a final project for Communications 188C - Data Science at UCLA. For this projectI  utilized a scraped sample of ~32k tweets about Coronavirus from 02/01 to 04/10 to test for a correlation between sentiment and Flesch Reading Ease Score.

"Twitter Flesch - DV.pptx/pdf" contains the presentation on the project.
"Twitter Flesch Paper.pdf" is the more formal final paper
"covid_tweet_analysis_rmd_file.pdf" is the pdf output of the rmd file "flesh_scores.Rmd ".

For a quick rundown I would recommend looking at the presentation first, then reading the RMD output to understand the methods.
